## About The App
This project is a test assignment for OAK Senior Frontend Developer position.

This represents a startup progress divided to 3 main stages.
Each stage can have unlimited amount of tasks. 
You can add tasks by clicking the action buttons at the bottom of the page.

The state is saved to the locale storage.

## Technologies
For building this application I have used Vite + React + Tailwind setup for faster development.

## Setup
- download or clone the repository
- run `npm install`
- run `npm run dev`'

## Improvement 
With the limited amount of time for that project, I've decided to not implement things that can be done in the future. 

- Removing tasks
- Implement option for multiple startups/stages
- Add state manager like Zustand
